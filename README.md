# A Parallel and Distributed Framework Focused into Computing-Intensive Applications For Partial Computation Reuse Estimation 

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg)

<p align="justify">
In the proposed framework, executions are performed under a modular workflow. In such a workflow, applications are executed as extensions, and a series of wrappers are used to adapt the execution contexts and automated computation reuse estimation. We explore the wrappers through specialized routines and address execution contexts, extending them in a dispatcher/worker architecture model. In such a scheme, while a dispatcher introduces an automated computation reuse estimation based on task overlap, a worker pool manages a series of workers, each performing an application replica with cache support. Figure 1 shows an overview of the framework structure.

## Features

<p align="justify">
- Sequential and Parallel Executions Using Python and C/C++ For Applications Description
- Cache space evaluation for different replacement policies without modifications into execution and application
- An intuitive workflow to introduces and evaluates novel task orchestrations
- Independence from computational architecture and operating system to manage and execute multiple workers
- Flexible structure for on-demand adaptations, enabling the study of different computational scenarios without changing the application execution model
